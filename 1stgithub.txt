In different contexts, "keyword" can refer to several things:

1. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Keywords are specific words or phrases that people enter into search engines. In SEO, targeting the right keywords is essential for improving a website's visibility in search results.

2. **Programming**: In programming languages, keywords are reserved words that have special meaning and cannot be used for other purposes (e.g., `if`, `else`, `while`, `class`). They are part of the syntax of the language.

3. **Databases**: Keywords can refer to specific terms used in queries to retrieve data (e.g., SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`).

4. **Research and Academia**: Keywords are terms or phrases that encapsulate the main topics of a research paper or article, helping others find and categorize the work.
